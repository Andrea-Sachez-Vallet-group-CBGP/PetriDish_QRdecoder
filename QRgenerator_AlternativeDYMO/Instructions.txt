Requirements
#Install qrencode and imagemagick
#sudo apt-get install qrencode
#sudo apt install imagemagick

- Make a Label file called Labels.txt. Format DATE_ISOLATE_TREATMENT_BREPLICATE_TREPLICATE_SIDE
- Make a folder called QRcodes
- Run the script QRencode.sh
- Print QRs with the windows tool (select images, right click, print, page of 35 images,  NOT fiting page). 
- Cut the QRs to be used in the sampling. The line is designed as 2cm but when printing it shrinks to 1cm. 
- Do the collection and the pictures. 
- Rename files using the code QRdecoder.sh . You need a folder called RawImages and one called Renamed. Run the code from the RawImages folder

WARNING: For another project, make sure that the label list doesn't have '$'\r'' for line jump. Error from the change of line. Solved in the QRdecoder script
